# Billboard Hot 100 Fluidity Analysis -- How Flattened Chart Belly Stagnated the Chart

If you have not been living under a rock, you would have heard of one of the biggest hits in 2019, Old Town Road, which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for a record-breaking 19 weeks. However, 19 weeks with the same song on # 1 could also cause a headache for Billboard Hot 100: a stagnant chart would wear on audience's interests. So in its 60+ years' history, Billboard Hot 100 has also updated its formula and chart policy a lot to balance its representativeness of music trend and the fluidity of the chart. For example, to relieve the stagnancy caused by the integration of SoundScan and BDS (Broadcast Data System) data in 1990s, Billboard established a new removal policy that a song will be permanently moved to 'recurrent status' if it has spent 20 weeks in the Hot 100 and fallen below position # 50. In the last decade, the policy was extended to remove descending songs ranking below # 25 after 52 weeks. However, even after these attempts to stimulate and re-activate the chart, there are still some complaints that the chart is becoming stagnant. So I start to wondering whether there is any way to measure the *fluidity* of the chart? If any, how does the *fluidity* of Billboard Hot 100 change over time? And why do people feel that the chart is becoming more stale? With these three questions in my mind, I started this mini project out of curiosity.

This project scraped the [Billboard Hot 100 chart](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100) from its very first issue dated Aug 2nd, 1958 to the recent release of Feb 1st, 2020, including the title, the artist, the trend (*New*, *Steady*, *Rising*, or *Failing*), and the specific position change of each song in chart. I first crafted some basic metrics (such as # of *New Entry*s, # of *Steady* songs, and average position change) to measure the *fluidity* of the chart, but found some contradictory evidences. Then I shifted my focus to the top part of the chart (Top 10/Top 40) as it had more public exposure thus may influence how stagnant people felt the chart was. In this process, several indicators, namely # of songs made it to top 10/top 40 and the distribution of duration in top 10/top 40, turned out to be helpful in resolving the contradiction and revealing why people found the chart stale in recent years.

## Part I: Get the Data
Two *Python* libs were employed to scraped the [Billboard Hot 100 chart](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100) history: *requests* and *bs4* (BeautifulSoup). To avoid being blocked by Billboard website, I set up a 5 seconds interval between each visit and let the script run for a whole night. The final data consisted of three datasets: title_df contained the title and artist info, change_df stored the position change info, and trend_df tracked the trend info (*New*, *Steady*, *Rising*, or *Failing*). Each dataset had 3210 columns and 100 rows (weekly Hot 100 from Aug 2nd, 1958 to Feb 1st, 2020). Below are the screenshots of title_df, change_df, and trend_df, respectively.

## Part II: The '*New*'s in Hot 100
Regarding measuring the *fluidity* of the chart, the first thing came to my mind was how many '*New*' songs Billboard Hot 100 had each year. Intuitively, the more '*New*' songs, the less stagnant the chart is. Below graph presented the final results. There were around 600 to 700 new songs each year at the early stage, but the number gradually declined to around 300 and bottomed out in 2001 with only 288 new entries. Then the recent two decades saw a wavering growth in total *New* songs and two spikes in 2011 and 2018, the latter of which actually carried the highest amount of '*New entrys*' since 1971. This evidence seemed to undermine the *Stagnant Chart Hypothesis*.

Next, let's take a look at how many songs debuted in the Top 40 and Top 10 over the years. As known, the manipuliation of the policy requiring availability in both retail and radio, the inclusion of digital download, and the inclusion of streaming data resulted in a lot of high-debut songs in Hot 100. Accordingly, we could see three major peaks around 1998, 2010, and 2018 in the graph below. The trend indicated that more and more new songs directly blasted into Top 40 even Top 10, which probably would make the chart more competitive and unpredictable. This evidence did not necessarily say that the chart was getting more current and lively, but at least it did not speak in favor of the *Stagnant Chart Hypothesis*.
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="visuals/new_songs_yearly_top40.html" height="350" width="100%"></iframe>  
***Conclusion*: Hot 100 saw more and more Top 40 even Top 10 debuts since 1990s along with a visible rise in '*New*' song in the last 2 decades, which did not support the *Stagnant Chart Hypothesis*.**

## Part III: The '*Steady*'s in Hot 100
The opposite of '*New*' is '*Steady*': the same old song on the same position for one more week, which is being stagnant in a hardcore way. Let see how many '*Steady*'s Hot 100 had each year. In the graph below, the x axis is year, and the y axis is the weekly average # of '*Steady*'s in chart. The three lines all soared in 1990s, when Billboard incorporated more accurate sales and radio data from SoundScan and BDS. After that, the lines all seemed to plateaued out, especially for Top 40 and Top 10.  
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="visuals/steady_songs_hot100.html" height="500" width="100%"></iframe>  
Additionally, if we also consider songs with no greater than 1 position change (+1, 0, and -1. Excluding debuting '*New*' songs) as being '*Steady*' and re-plot the graph, we could see a even more plateaued-out trend for all three lines, which implied that there was a higher proportion of '*Steady*'s in chart than before.  
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="visuals/steady_songs_hot100_expanded.html" height="500" width="100%"></iframe>  
To see a more detailed trend over time, I grouped the 62 years data by decade (actually by every 535 weeks) and counted the '*Steady*'s (with <= 1 position change) on each chart position. The x axis of the following graph is the chart position from #1 to #40, and the y axis of it is the count of '*Steady*' on a certain chart position in a certain time period. The graph clearly illustrated that Hot 100 saw more '*Steady*'s on its top part for the last 3 decades that it did for earlier decades. This could be largely explained by the inclusion of SoundScan and BDS data. But, given the conclusion of Part II, where did the influence of those increased '*New*' songs go?
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="visuals/steady_songs_position_decennialy_expanded.html" height="350" width="100%"></iframe>   
***Conclusion*: Hot 100 contained a relatively high portion of '*Steady*' songs for the last 3 decades and the trend seemed set to continue. Interestingly, the chart was having high volumes of '*New*' songs and '*Steady*' songs at the same time for recent decades, which seemed contradictory and made it tricky to determine whether the chart was getting more and more stagnant.**  

## Part IV: The '*Tenure*' of Songs
Above analyses focused on two specific statuses of songs in chart: '*New*' and '*Steady*', and got conflicting conclusions. What if we take the chart as a whole and see how many songs made it to the chart and how long they spent in chart? Below graph presented how many unique songs appeared in each year's Hot 100 chart (a song could appear in 2 or more years' charts). This chart looked and should look similar to the '*New*' songs graph in [Part II](#part-ii-the-news-in-hot-100) as every '*New Entry*' was also a unique song in chart.

However, if we look at the same graph for Top 40 and Top 10, something interesting emerged. From previous investigation we learnt that more and more songs debuted in Top 40 even Top 10 in chart, but below graph was telling us that the total number of songs made it to Top 40 and especially Top 10 every year actually stayed almost the same since 1990s. With that being said, my guess in Part II that more high debuts would make the chart more competitive turned out to be false. So what would be a reasonable explaination for the concurrence of high volumes in both '*New*'s and '*Steady*'s? My updated assumption was that these high debuts were just Top 40 or Top 10 candidates that entered the Top 40 or Top 10 weeks ealier than their counterparts used to do. Accordingly, the total number of songs made it to top part of the chart did not change much. To verify my new assumption, I checked songs' duration in Hot 100, Top 40, and Top 10. Coincidentally, it was in this process that I found the key information to answer why people found the chart stale in recent years. 
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="visuals/unique_songs_yearly_top40.html" height="350" width="100%"></iframe>  
First graph was the duration of songs in Hot 100, Top 40, Top 10, and Top 1. Little extra information could this visual provide as most patterns were expected: the longer duration, the fewer songs; and a spike in 20 weeks due to the removal policy mentioned at the beginning of this report. Nothing noticeably unusual. 
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="visuals/duration_hot100.html" height="350" width="100%"></iframe>  
Something started to change when we grouped the data by decade (actually 535 weeks, and for simplicity, I will refer to it as decade): there were huge gaps in the duration distribution among different decades. For the early decades, we could see a belly in the curve with most songs falling between 5 to 15 weeks and a short tail stretched over 20 weeks. However, the belly started to flatten and evetually disappeared in and after 2000s. Conversely, the tail swelled and grew longer that ever. And what's more, an unexpected spike sprang up at 1 week in 2010s. This highly skewed curve gave us a hint: your song was more likely than ever to become either a one-week wonder or a nail house in chart. The same pattern went on when we turned to Top 40 and Top 10 (shown in the appendix).
