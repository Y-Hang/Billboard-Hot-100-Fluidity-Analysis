Billboard Hot 100 has witnessed the rise and fall of various music genres and audio formats in the U.S. since 60+ years ago. Its formula and chart policy have also evolved a lot to balance the representativeness of music trend and the fluidity of the chart. For example, a song will be permanently moved to 'recurrent status' if it has spent 20 weeks on the Hot 100 and fallen below position # 50. Additionally, descending songs are removed from the chart if ranking below # 25 after 52 weeks. However, in recent years, there are still some complaints that the chart is becoming more and more stagnant. So is there any way to measure the *fluidity* of the chart? If any, how does the *fluidity* of Billboard Hot 100 change over time? And why do people feel that the chart is becoming more stale? With these three questions in my mind, I started this project.

This project scraped the [Billboard Hot 100 chart](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100) from its very first issue dated Aug 2nd, 1958 to the latest release of Feb 1st, 2020, including the title, the artist, the trend (*New*, *Steady*, *Rising*, or *Failing*), and the specific position change of each song on chart. I first crafted some basic metrics (such as # of *New Entry*s, # of *Steady* songs, and average position change) to measure the *fluidity* of the chart, but found some contradictory evidences. Then I shifted my focus to the top part of the chart (Top 10/Top 40) as it had more public exposure thus may influence how stagnant people felt the chart was. In this process, several metrics, namely # of songs made it to top 10/top 40, and the distribution of duration on top 10/top 40, turned out to be helpful in resolving the contradiction and revealing why people found the chart stale.

## Part I: Get the Data
Two *Python* libs were employed to scraped the [Billboard Hot 100 chart](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100) history: *requests* and *bs4* (BeautifulSoup). To avoid being blocked by Billboard website, I set up a 5 seconds interval between each visit and let the script run for a whole night. The final data consisted of three datasets: title_df contained the title and artist info, change_df stored the position change info, and trend_df tracked the trend info (*New*, *Steady*, *Rising*, or *Failing*). Each dataset had 3210 columns and 100 rows (weekly Hot 100 from Aug 2nd, 1958 to Feb 1st, 2020). Below are the screenshots of title_df, change_df, and trend_df, respectively.

## Part II: The '*New*'s in Hot 100
Regarding measuring the *fluidity* of the chart, the first thing came to my mind was how many '*New*' songs Billboard Hot 100 had each year. Intuitively, the more *New* songs, the less stagnant the chart is. Below graph presents the # of '*New*' songs charted on each year's Billboard Hot 100. There were around 700 new songs each year at the early stage, but the amount gradually declined to around 300 and bottomed out in 2001 with 288 new entries. Then the recent two decades saw a wavering growth in total amount and two peaks in 2011 and 2018, the latter of which actually carried the highest new entry amount since 1971.

Next, let's take a look at how many songs debuted in the Top 40 and Top 10 over the years. With three major spikes around 1998, 2010, and 2018 (Supposedly, they were related to chart policy on radio, digital download, and streaming, respectively), the result indicated that more and more new songs made high debutes on chart, which, technically speaking, should raise the perceived fluidity of the chart as audience would see a more competitive and unpredictable chart.

**Conclusion: Hot 100 saw more and more *Hot Shot Debut*s since 1990s and an increase in '*New*' song for last the 2 decades, which does not support the *Stagnant Chart Hypothesis*.**

## Part III: The '*Steady*'s in Hot 100
The opposite of '*New*' is '*Steady*': the same old song on the same position for one more week, which is being stagnant in a hardcore way. Let see how many '*Steady*'s each year's chart had in Hot 100, Top 40 and Top 10. In the graph below, the x axis is year, and the y axis is the weekly average # of '*Steady*'s on chart. The three lines all soared in 1990s, when Billboard incorporated more accurate sales and radio data from SoundScan and BDS (Broadcast Data Systems). After that, the lines all seemed to plateaued out, especially for Top 40 and Top 10.  
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="visuals/steady_songs_hot100.html" height="500" width="100%"></iframe>  
Additionally, if we also consider songs with no greater than 1 position change (+1, 0, and -1. Excluding debuting '*New*' songs) as being '*Steady*' and re-plot the graph, we could see a even more plateaued-out trend for all three lines, which implied that there was a higher proportion of '*Steady*'s on chart than before.
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="visuals/steady_songs_hot100_expanded.html" height="500" width="100%"></iframe>  
To see a more detailed trend over time, I grouped the 62 years data by decade (actually by every 535 weeks) and counted the '*Steady*'s (with <= 1 position change) on each chart position. The x axis of the following graph is the chart position from #1 to #40, and the y axis of it is the count of '*Steady*' on a certain chart position in a certain time period. The graph clearly illustrated that Hot 100 saw more '*Steady*'s on its top part for the last 3 decades that it did for earlier decades. 
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="visuals/steady_songs_position_decennialy_expanded.html" height="350" width="100%"></iframe>  
This definitely would make a chart stagnant. However, the inclusion of SoundScan and BDS data happened almost 30 years ago and already became well-received. It could explain why the chart was more stale in recent 3 decades than in its beginning decades, but could not answer why people found the chart more stagnant in recent years. I wanted to find out more recent causes and issues. 

**Conclusion: Hot 100 contained a high amount of '*Steady*' songs for the last 3 decades and the trend seemed set to continue. Interestingly, the chart was having high volumes of '*New*' songs and '*Steady*' songs at the same time for recent decades, which seemed contradictory and made it hard to determine whether the chart was getting more and more stagnant.**

## Part IV: The '*Tenure*' of Songs
Above analyses focused on two specific statuses of songs on chart: '*New*' and '*Steady*', and got conflicting conclusions. What if we take the chart as a whole and see how many songs made it to the chart and how long did they spend on chart? Below graph presented how many unique songs appeared on each year's Hot 100 chart (a song could appear in 2 or more years' charts). This chart looked and should look similar to the '*New*' songs graph in [Part II](#part-ii-the-news-in-hot-100) as every '*New Entry*' was a unique song on chart.

However, if we look at the same graph for Top 40 and Top 10, anomaly emerged. From below graph we could tell that though more and more songs debuted on Top 40 even Top 10 on chart, the total number of songs made it to Top 40 and Top 10 every year actually stayed almost the same since 1990s. What's the implication of this anomaly?
