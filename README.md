# Billboard-Hot-100-Fluidity-Analysis
This project scraped the [Billboard Hot 100 chart](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100) from its very first issue dated Aug 2nd, 1958 to the chart of Feb 1st, 2020, including the title, the artist, the trend (*New*, *Steady*, *Rising*, or *Failing*), and the specific position change of each song on chart. I first crafted some basic metrics (such as # of *New Entry*s, # of *Steady* songs, and average position change) to measure the *fluidity* of the chart, but found some contradictary evidences to this question. Then I shifted my focus to the top part of the chart (Top 10/Top 40) as the public were more exposed to this info thus this may influence how stagnant they feel the chart was. Several metrics, namely # of songs made it to top 10/top 40, and the distribution of weeks on top10/top 40, turned out to be revealing in resolving the contradiction and answering why people found the chart more stagnant. The full report is still under construction, and you can visit [here](https://y-hang.github.io/Billboard-Hot-100-Fluidity-Analysis/) to take a look.
